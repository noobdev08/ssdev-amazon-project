# Amazon Clone – SSDev Project

[Live Demo](https://noob-amazon-clone.vercel.app)

This is a **multi-page Amazon clone** built for practice and learning purposes. The **HTML and CSS were provided** by the tutorial, and I implemented the **JavaScript functionality** to make the site interactive.

---

## Features Implemented

* **Shopping Cart Functionality:** Add, remove, and update items using **JavaScript and localStorage**.
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** Navigate between pages like Home, Cart, Checkout, and Orders.
* **Basic Interactivity:** Buttons, forms, and navigation menus responding to user actions.

> ⚠️ Note: The HTML structure and CSS styling were provided by the tutorial; the JS implementation is my work.

## Tech Used

* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage
* **HTML5 & CSS3** – Provided by the tutorial
